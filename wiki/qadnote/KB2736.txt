WME('Cause: '); 
Cause:  
A word-break rule file has been associated with the database and cannot be found. These files are named "proword.<table-num>".
For example: proword.1
WME('Fixes: '); 
Fixes:  
Check whether the file exists in the Progress installation directory (DLC) and whether its permissions are set correctly.
Additionally, verify whether an environment variable PROWDn=<path_to_proword.n> is defined. (n = the rule-number specified when the proutil wbreak-compiler was run).
If this file doesn't exist, as a last resort the word-break rule can be changed back to the default by doing the following:
        proutil <database> -C word-rules 0
        proutil <database> -C idxbuild all
WME('Notes: '); 
Notes:  
Changing the word-break rule of the database will impact the search capabilities of the application. Expect any search using the CONTAINS operator to make use of word-indexes to return different results if the word-break rule is changed. WME('Notes: '); Reference to Written Documentation:
