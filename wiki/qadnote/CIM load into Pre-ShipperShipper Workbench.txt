Goal:  CIM load into Pre-Shipper/Shipper Workbench 
Fact:  CIM 
Fact:  MFG/PRO eB 
Fact:  7.9.2 Pre-Shipper/Shipper Workbench 
Fact:  rcshwb.p
 
Fact:  7.9.8 Sales Order Shipper Maintenance 
Fact:  rcshmt.p
 
Symptom:  Cannot CIM into Pre-Shipper/Shipper Workbench
 
Fix:  Certain CIM options have been enabled when CIMing a document via Pre-Shipper/Shipper Workbench.  Shippers/Pre-shippers are enabled to allow the following:

Add Options:
1 - Add Item   2 - Add New Container   3 - Add New Container (plus Contents)  4 - Add Existing Container

Once this option is selected, the Item information or container information frame is called for the update of the shipper line.  The following CIM formatted file may assist in terms of concepts (parentheses are included for description only and should not be included with the file:

@@batchload rcshwb.p
"lf010" "Shipper" ""  "lfcust"                (site/shipper/ID/Customer)
"Carrier" - "Ship Via"
1                                (Note: Emulating Add Item Option)
- - "SO12032"  1                (Sales Order and Line Number provided and additional two - should be added before Sales Order in eB2 and above to accommodate Customer Reference and Model Year)
5 "EA"

.                                (F4 out to avoid printing shipper/optional)
.

In certain cases the picked or allocated quantity requires modification, this can be accomplished by CIMing into 7.9.8 Sales Order Shipper Maintenance after completing the creation of the shipper or pre-shipper.

This will enable the following concept:

Run 7.9.1 manually to generate a Pre-shipper pick list

FTP the pick list over to a third party warehouse managing company

Receive file(s) from this company confirming shipment and quantities
shipped
    
FTP quantities shipped differ from original quantities on the pick-list
then modify the quantities on the Pre-shipper or Shipper (CIM process)

Confirm the Shipper (7.9.5)
