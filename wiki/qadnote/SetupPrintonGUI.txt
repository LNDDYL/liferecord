Fill in Lines/Page as you like (page-breaks will be added). Paste works OK in Write and in Word, but not in notepad. This works for Progress version 7 + higher only. 

5. Printing to Window 

For 8.3k, and 8.4g, ECO G1MR is necessary before you can print to WINDOW. This ECO includes a utility uxprup.p that will insert the necessary records in the MFG/PROqaddb database in order to print all GUI reports and inquiries to a Notebook-like editor widget. Previously, only so-called "FullGui" reports could be printed in 
this way. This ECO is not needed for 8.3m, 8.4h, 8.5 and 8.6.
