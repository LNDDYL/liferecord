QAD, Inc. 
License Code Sheet 
You will be prompted to enter the license code number(s) on this sheet when you install MFG/PRO. 
Please safeguard this document. 
There is a provision in QAD's software to monitor the count of sessions and user ID's. This utility 
will help you identify how many sessions are started / running on the database at any given point 
in time. The license code number at the bottom of this sheet will identify to the software the number 
of sessions for which you are licensed at the referenced site location. 
Each time a user logs onto MFG/PRO, it will show the total of sessions logged on and the total 
number of licensed sessions allowed on MFG/PRO per your license agreement. If a warning 
message appears stating that the usage of the software exceeds the number of licensed sessions, 
please contact your QAD sales representative or distributor to increase the number of licensed 
sessions for your system. A new license code will be issued at that time. 
The license code numbers are QAD confidential information subject to the terms and conditions of 
your non-disclosure agreement. QAD considers any attempt to disable the count of sessions and or 
system user monitoring to be a violation of your license agreement.
