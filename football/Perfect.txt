Oh I was perfect for the circus哦，我曾是场上最完美的

Cause he never seemed satisfied 因为他似乎从没有满足过 

I know I'm not perfect 我知道我还不够完美 
But at the end of the day, who is?但是在一天的结束，谁能完美？ 
He wanted someone this perfect 他想要完美情人 
When love came, but can you tell me who is? 当爱情来临，你能告诉我谁可以完美？

But I still kept on reaching 但我还在努力 
He watched me at least a thousand times他看着我，至少有一千次 
If he loved me, he'd stop me, but no 如果他爱我，就该阻止我，但是，他没有 

I saw my future in his eyes 我在他眼中看到自己的未来
